## Notes

(November 5th, 2021)

I made it a point to focus on my overall workflow for this challenge, putting everything I picked up in my [previous challenge](https://github.com/Sakeran/fem-space-tourism-site) into practice. Focusing on the planning stage up front (and building out the components first) took a little more time than I'd anticipated, but I found that once I'd gotten through that, the time it took to build out the actual page was less than half of what I'd normally spend.

Granted, this design wasn't especially difficult to implment, but I think the takeaway here is that I need to work on cutting down the time taken during the planning stage. Some of that will just be a matter of practice - quickly identifying things like spacing and colors - but on a more practical level, I should try to start working from a basic set of utility and layout classes where possible. While there is a certain sense of satisfaction that comes with writing custom CSS for each project, it does lead to me doing a lot of duplicate, time-wasting work.
